System Requirements:
- Web server with rewrite features (Apache2 or lighttpd should work)
- PHP (version 5.3 or higher)
	- must be compiled to support mysqli (default in most binary installations)
- MySQL (version 5.1 or higher)

SETUP:
------

Site configuration:
The file config.php.example in the include subdirectory contains all relevant
configuration options. All options should be self-explanatory, and must be set
prior to taking the system into use.
The must be renamed (or copied) to config.php before it will be used by the code.

Web server configuration:
The system expects your web server to rewrite all requests to the document
root to the index.php file, except those of the subdirectories css and js.
Given the many web servers available we cannot supply a working universal
configuration for each. The following can be used as a host configuration for
lighttpd (tested on version 1.4):

$HTTP["host"] =~ "PUT_YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME_HERE" {
        server.document-root = "PUT_THE_PATH_TO_THIS_DIR_HERE"

        url.rewrite-once = (
                "/(.*)\.(.*)" => "$0",
                "/(css|files|img|js|stats)/" => "$0",
                "^/([^.]+)$" => "/index.php/$1"
        )
}

This requires the rewrite module to be loaded in your lighttpd configuration.
In Apache, use the mod_rewrite module. We leave this up to the users to handle.

Database:
The file girafplace.sql.gz contains the entire database structure of the site.
Run it on your database to install it ready for use. Note that no data is
created for your use. That must be done manually.

USAGE:
------

As described in the report, there are no interfaces for working with children,
groups, devices or applications.

Insert data into these tables:
	- profiles (children)
	- groups
	- devices (reference created children in ownerId)
	- applications (create a contactbook entry. Values are irrelevant EXCEPT
	  for applicationSystemName. This must be 'contactbook')

Afterwards, insert relationship data into these tables:
	- childGroupKeys (connecting children you inserted to groups you inserted)
	- childUserKeys (connecting children to users - make sure to create a user
	  in the login screen)
	- devAppKeys (devices to applications)
	- userGroupKeys
	
DEMO:
-----
We suggest using the demo site residing on http://giraf.homestead.dk to look at
functionality instead of trying to install.
